# üåç Project Problem Statement  
**Title:** Sustainable Air Quality Monitoring using CNN and AQI-to-Cigarette Conversion

---

## üîé Problem Definition
Air pollution has become one of the most critical environmental and health challenges across the world.  
In countries like **India and Nepal**, rapid urbanization and industrial growth have led to severe air quality deterioration.

Traditional air quality monitoring systems rely on expensive sensors and limited geographical coverage.  
Our goal is to develop a **computer vision-based system** that can estimate the **Air Quality Index (AQI)** directly from **images of the environment**, enabling scalable, low-cost air pollution awareness.

## üéØ Project Objective
1. Build a **CNN-based Image Classifier** trained on the *Air Pollution Image Dataset from India and Nepal* to categorize scenes into **six AQI levels**:
   - Good  
   - Moderate  
   - Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups  
   - Unhealthy  
   - Very Unhealthy  
   - Hazardous  

2. Integrate the model into an **interactive web application** that:
   - Predicts the AQI category from an image.  
   - Converts the estimated AQI/PM2.5 into an **equivalent number of cigarettes** (for awareness).  
   - Displays dynamic **visualizations** and **health recommendations**.

---

## üí° Problem Significance
- Raises **public awareness** about pollution severity through visual indicators.  
- Promotes **sustainability and smart city development** by providing low-cost air quality estimation.  
- Supports **SDG Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities** and **Goal 13: Climate Action**.  
- Enables **real-time environmental monitoring** using deep learning and open data.
